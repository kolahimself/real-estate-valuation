Numeric features include house age, transit_distance, No of Convinient Stores, latitude & longitude

The results aren't conclusive, but looking closely at plots [X5 latitude](https://github.com/kolahimself/real-estate-valuation/blob/main/images/numerical-correlations/X5%20latitude.png) and [X6 longitude](https://github.com/kolahimself/real-estate-valuation/blob/main/images/numerical-correlations/X6%20longitude.png), a vague diagonal trend shows that higher prices of houses coincide with higher values of latitude and longitude (sparsely houses quite much farther away).

Also, the plots from [X3](https://github.com/kolahimself/real-estate-valuation/blob/main/images/numerical-correlations/X3%20distance%20to%20the%20nearest%20MRT%20station.png) show negative correlations. Indicating that house far away from rail stations tend to be less expensive.
