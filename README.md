# `Real Estate Valuation`

> this project is an attempt to a regression challenge, view the challenge [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/modules/train-evaluate-regression-models/9-summary)

## Description
Predicting the selling price of a residential property depends on a number of factors, including the property age, availability of local amenities, and location.

The contents of this repository and project as a whole are aimed at predicting the price-per-unit of a property on its features using a dataset of real estate transactions. The price-per-unit in this data is based on a unit measurement of 3.3 square meters.

## Objectives
Major objectives to be achieved are:
- Exploration and preparation of data
- Identification of potentially predictive features as regards the price-per-unit-label
- Training a regression model that achieves 
  - a root mean square error (RMSE) not more than 7. 
  - a coefficient of determination at least 80% in value.
